# Recipe Search (aka API Muncher)

[API Muncher](https://api-muncher.herokuapp.com/) is a solo Rails project focusing on consuming a third-party API. The site takes user input for searches and then calls the Edamam API to JSON results. The JSON is then parsed for recipe display to users.  

This project focused on experience in full request/response cycles and the role of APIs. I took care in understanding the processes involved by going back through my work and [writing](https://github.com/brianaeng/api-muncher/blob/master/lib/edamam_api_wrapper.rb) [comments](https://github.com/brianaeng/api-muncher/blob/master/app/controllers/homepages_controller.rb).
