# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

# This has all the secrets.
.env

# Our VCR test helper thing is going to save our request URLs which have our secrets in them! This may change after the addition of the filter_sensitive_data bit in the test helper. We'll see. 
test/cassettes/

# If I decide to use simplecov, don't want to check these in.
/coverage
